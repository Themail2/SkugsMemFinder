# SkugsMemFinder

This program finds the memory address of the boolean variable that tells the game which player has won from a random instanciantion of SkullGirls.exe

You can verify that these address are correct from the cheat engine cheat table provided in this repository.

I hope this helps other people with this wildly specific problem.
